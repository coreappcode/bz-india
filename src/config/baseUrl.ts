/**
 * Single source of truth for the public website origin.
 *
 * - The Capacitor WebView serves the bundled app from `https://localhost`
 *   (see capacitor.config.ts `server.androidScheme`). That origin is an
 *   internal implementation detail and MUST NEVER be exposed to users
 *   (share links, copy-link, social share, deep links, canonical/SEO,
 *   browser opens, email redirect URLs, etc.).
 *
 * - Every user-facing URL generation MUST resolve through `BASE_URL` (or the
 *   `buildAppRedirect()` helper in `utils/authEnv.ts` which is layered on
 *   top of this). The configured public origin is used for the active market;
 *   the global BZEAD.COM origin remains the default outside market builds.
 *
 * - This does NOT change Capacitor's internal WebView origin or routing.
